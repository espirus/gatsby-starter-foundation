The details in Birthdays can explain the dynamic of 2 people and so much more, even to give one some confirmation or an edge as i see relationships as in investment of time, money, emotions and so forth.

 Harry was born on September 15th, which is one of the rare Virgos to love geminis and leos. Most virgos will have other preferences depending on the specific date. Meghan, is born on august the 4th which makes her a loveable Leo. Oh and by the way,one Prince harrys most charming characteristic is loveable, like Tom Hardy. Another attraction?

One of the most beautiful things about Prince Harry and Meghan's relationship is the emotional connection they have with each other. They have both spoken openly about how they support each other through tough times, and how they always have each other's backs. This emotional bond will be evident in their son Archie with Prince Harry as his emotional sign{Moon sign} is taurus, who has brought them even closer together as a family. Archie will have impeccable manners thanks to his Mom. Lilibet is just another wonderful addition to the family dynamic who will be fun and bring out the best in Mom.



Looking to the future, Prince Harry and Meghan seem to be on the path to a happy life together and love getting stronger. If they decide to expand their family, as a birthday specialist I suggests that another Leo, born on the 4th or 13th of August, or a Libra, born on the 28th of September, 10th of October, or 19th of October would be a great fit to all.  When it comes to expanding their family, the specific Birthday can provide some insight, but ultimately, the decision should be made by the couple themselves, considering not only the details in the specific birthday but their personal preferences



Overall, it seems that Prince Harry's intuition and letting his heart guide him in his choice of a partner has led him to find true love and happiness with Meghan Markle, and they are a perfect match not only by feelings but also by birthdays. We wish them all the best in their journey together as a family.
